 <Marquee><p>I DON'T KNOW HOW TO MARRY MY INTERESTS I REALLY LIKE DESIGN I REALLY LIKE ILLUSTRATION I KNOW THEY CROSSOVER IN CERTAIN ASPECTS BUT IT'S NEVER REALLY TALKED ABOUT IN ANY OF MY GRAPHIC DESIGN CLASSES WHY DO I HAVE TO TAKE A PAINTING AND DRAWING CLASS TO GET CLOSE TO ILLUSTRATION MAYBE IM DUMB MAYBE IM OVERTHINKING THIS MAYBE THE ANSWER IS SIMPLE</p></Marquee>

    <h2>DESIGNER</h2>
    <p class="paragraph" id="box-model">As longwinded and word-heavy as Michael Rock's essay is, it was the only thing I've read where a designer acknowledged children books and graphic novels. "Many illustrators have used the book in wholly inventive ways and produced serious work."</p>
<br>
<p class="paragraph" id="box-model"><span class="key-word"></span> Some people view illustration as something that is very separate from the realm of design. When I was applying to the graphic design program at Purchase I asked if there would be opportunities to produce illustrated work. I was told to switch to painting and drawing. Did I do that? No. Instead I squeezed illustration into every graphic design project that I could.</p>
<br>
<p class="paragraph" id="box-model"><span class="key-word"></span> Scrolling through twitter is funny because artists are constanly complaining about relatives asking them to design business cards and logos. The general public often fails to differentiate between artist and designer. So what if you're both? That's how I consider myself. It says Designer + Illustrator right on my resume. Yet for some reason it's invoked some bizarre, artistic identity crisis. My design work informs my illustration work and vice versa, but at the same time it feels like wearing two completely different hats.</p>
<br>
<p class="paragraph" id="box-model"><span class="key-word"></span>Of course design incorporates illustration. Or rather, it can. However there are so many different "types" and "styles" and purposes for illustration. There's design as illustration, and illustration as design.</p>
